            Pichai speaking at the 2015 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain
            Pichai worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and in management consulting at
            McKinsey & Company.Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product management and innovation efforts for
            a suite of Google's client software products, including Google Chromeand Chrome OS, as well as being largely
            responsible for Google Drive. He went on to oversee the development of other applications such as Gmail and

            of the new video codec VP8 by Google and introduced the new video format, WebM.
            <br>
            <br>
    
            On March 13, 2013, Pichai added Android to the list of Google products that he oversaw. Android was formerly
            managed by Andy Rubin. He was a director of Jive Software from April 2011 to July 30, 2013.
            Pichai was selected to become the next CEO of Google on August 10, 2015after previously being appointed
            Product Chief by CEO, Larry Page. On October 24, 2015 he stepped into the new position at the completion of the
            formation of Alphabet Inc., the new holding company for the Google company family.
    <br>
    <br>
            Pichai had been suggested as a contender for Microsoft's CEO in 2014, a position that was eventually given to
            Satya Nadella. <br>
            <br>
            In August 2017, Pichai drew publicity for firing a Google employee who wrote a ten-page manifesto criticizing
            the company's diversity policies and arguing that "distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women
            differ in part due to biological causes and ... these differences may explain why we don't see equal
            representation of women in tech and leadership". While noting that the manifesto raised a number
            of issues that are open to debate, Pichai said in a memo to Google employees that "to suggest a group of our
            colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.
                <br>
            <br>
    
            In December 2017, Pichai was a speaker at the World Internet Conference in China, where he stated that "a lot of
            work Google does is to help Chinese companies. There are many small and medium-sized businesses in China who
            take advantage of Google to get their products to many other countries outside of China

            <strong><h2> U.S. Congressional testimony </h2></strong>
            <hr>
    
            On December 11, 2018, Sundar Pichai was questioned by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on a range of Google-related issues such as possible political bias on Google's platforms, the company's alleged plans for a "censored search app" in China, and its privacy practices.In response, Pichai informed the committee that Google employees cannot influence search results. He also stated that Google users can opt out of having their data collected and that "there are no current plans for a censored search engine" in China. Wired's Issie Lapowsky characterized Pichai's appearance before the committee as a "major missed opportunity," since, as she wrote, its members "staked out opposite sides of a partisan battle".
    
            
            In October 2020, the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation unanimously voted in favor of, and on a bipartisan basis, to subpoena Pichai, along with the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter, to testify before the committee in response to lawmakers' concerns over the technology industry's exemption from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1934.[54]
